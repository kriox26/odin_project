# Twitter Spambot

This is command line Twitter client, build from [JumpStart Lab Twitter Spambot's](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html) example. For [The Odin Project - Ruby on the Web](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-on-the-web)
Run `$ ruby micro_blogger.rb` in the main directory to begin.

This are the few thins you can do(for doing them you must have a twitter account):
* Tweet something
* Spam all your followers sending the messages!
* Send a message to a single follower
* See last tweets of all followers
* Shorten some URL
* And finally get a nicer format for a tweet with the Shorten url

When the program starts it'll wait until you ask it to do something. Here are some examples:
```
