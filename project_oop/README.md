#  Project - OOP

Couple of fun programming problems, build using Ruby and the concepts of OOP(Object oriented programming), from [Projects: OOP](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop).

## Tic Tac Toe

You should run the game like this: `$ ruby tic_tac_toe.rb `

### Game play

When the game starts, it ask you for the name of two players, the player number 1 will have the mark X and the player number two the mark O.
Then, the welcome message will appear: 

`
Name of player 1(mark= X): Agustin

Name of player 2(mark= O): Matias
|

| 1 | 2 | 3   The positions to play on the tic-tac-toe board are

|---+---+---  represented by the numbers 1 - 9 as shown in the

| 4 | 5 | 6   figure at the left.

|---+---+---  To place an 'X' or 'O' in a certain position, simply

| 7 | 8 | 9   enter the number corresponding to that position.

|

|

`


Here is a sample output for the first two moves:
`
Agustin, input position to mark: 5
   |
   |   |   |
   |---+---+---
   |   | X |
   |---+---+---
   |   |   |
   |
   |
Matias, input position to mark: 1
   |
   | O |   |
   |---+---+---
   |   | X |
   |---+---+---
   |   |   |
   |
   |
`

Once you finish, it will tell you if it was a draw, if not it will tell you name of the winner. Enjoy!!!
