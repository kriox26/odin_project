## Caesar Cipher RSpecs - [TOP](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/testing-ruby?ref=lc-pb)

Here are the RSpecs I created to the Testing project of The Odin Project - Ruby programming course.
The tests are:
* Test when parameters are right, meaning that string and a key is given.
* Test when not all parameters are given.

To see the output of the test, run `$ rake` on the main directory.

That's it!
