## Advanced Building Blocks RSpecs - [TOP](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/testing-ruby?ref=lc-pb)

RSpecs for this 6 enumerable methods:
* `#my_count`
* `#my_select`
* `#my_all?`
* `#my_none?`
* `#my_any?`
* `#my_map`

The tests cover two main cases, when a block is given and a block is not given. Then inside each case, tests for some other more specific things.
To see the output of the specs, run `$ rake` on the main directory.

That's it.
