## Project Testing - [The Odin Project, Ruby programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/testing-ruby?ref=lc-pb)

##### From The Odin Project:
A good way to get familiar with and begin contributing to a new project is to write tests for it. It's also the best way to become familiar with a new code base, something you'll have to do when you start working. It's pretty common for test code to ultimately take up twice as many lines of code as the actual project code!

You still may feel shaky on RSpec at this point (which is totally natural), so let's go back in time and write tests for some of the code you've already done to build up a bit of muscle memory. If you've written a good batch, submit them below and we'll include them as part of the original project description to help future students!
