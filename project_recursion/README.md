####Fibonacci
* `#fib_iterative(number)` - returns an array of the fibonacci sequence up to number.
* `#fib_recursive(number)` - it does the same thing, but uses a recursive algorithm.
Run `$ ruby fib.rb` to see the output of the fibonacci sequence.


####Merge sort
* `#merge_sort(array)` - sorts the array using a recursive implementation of the [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQ8pwjQxTM).
* `#merge_arrays(left,right)` - merge left with right, from lower to higher numbers.
Run `$ ruby merge.rb` to see the output of the sorted array.
